Pseudocode/Story:

User 1 arrives at Montg. Station, and decides to play Waldo (of course). User 1 logs in, and selects Montg. from drop-down list, then which train they're waiting for (since no game has started at that station). Since User 1 is first player at that station, he becomes Waldo and a new game is created. Waldo writes basic visual description of self, receives a random key (for later), and hopes not to get found (sees countdown until train arrives). User 2 arrives at same station. 2 selects Montg. from drop-down, and since there is already a game in session at that station, is added to the user list for that game. 2 sees a countdown until Waldo's train arrives, and if s/he discovers Waldo within that
